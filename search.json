    "text": "Note: Cross-posted with rOpenSci blog.\nIn the last post, we used the qualtRics1 package to import survey data directly from Qualtrics accounts. I often use Qualtrics for survey data collected via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, which is an automated system that connects online respondents to paid surveys. However, sometimes those data are not super useful because the quality of the data is poor. In the anonymous, large-scale market of online survey respondents, the financial incentives for completing surveys attract respondents who blast through the study just to collect the money or, worse, automated bots programmed to act like humans and reap the incentives. 🤖 As a scientist, I’m collecting survey data to understand human nature, so I’m looking for honest responses. But low-quality data can be common in online surveys, and not just on Mechanical Turk2.\nThere are some cues that data may come from bots, such as entries originating from outside of your specified country or multiple entries coming from the same IP address. Cues of inattentive human participants include not completing the survey, completing it very quickly or slowly, or ignoring your requests to use specific types of devices (e.g., desktop computers not phones or tablets). I call these kinds of cues metadata because they are not direct responses from the respondents but are information about how the respondent took the survey. After repeatedly creating filters to deal with these problematic metadata, I formalized them into my first R package called excluder3.\nIn Part 2 of this series, we’ll use excluder to remove potentially problematic metadata. First, we’ll learn how to set up your Qualtrics survey to collect the relevant information. Then we’ll learn how to mark, check, and exclude observations based on the metadata. Finally, we’ll clean up our data sets by deidentifying them."

    "section": "Before collecting your data",
    "text": "Before collecting your data\nAs a reminder, excluder focuses on metadata about an entry rather than the actual responses. If you have particular questions from your specific survey that you want to use to exclude data (for example, questions specifically designed to check the attentiveness of respondents), you should use regular subset/filter functions from base R or dplyr. Here, we’re focusing on metadata collected about your survey respondents.\nBut to use this metadata, you must first collect it! Though the excluder package can work with metadata from other survey systems (e.g., SurveyMonkey), we’ll focus on data coming from Qualtrics surveys. There are two options in Qualtrics that allow you to collect the metadata that excluder can work with.\n\nAnonymous vs. non-anonymous data\nFirst, Qualtrics can collect either anonymous or non-anonymous data. Non-anonymous data include IP address, geolocation, and contact information provided by you (if you have Qualtrics email your respondents). To collect non-anonymous data, you must toggle the switch Off under Survey &gt; Options &gt; Security &gt; Anonymize responses. If you collect non-anonymous data, just make sure that respondents know that you’re collecting their IP address and location4.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Jeffrey Stevens\n\n\nComputer metadata\nIn addition to IP address and location, Qualtrics can also collect information about the computer environment that respondents use to take your survey, such as operating system, browser type and version, and screen resolution. To collect the computer metadata, you must create a question in your survey in a block that already has another question. Click Add a new question and select the Meta info question type.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Jeffrey Stevens"

    "section": "Removing problematic data",
    "text": "Removing problematic data\nNow that we’ve collected the proper metadata, we can use it to deal with potentially problematic data.\n\nMetadata\nHere are seven types of metadata that excluder works with, along with their tags that are used in excluder functions.\n\nQualtrics preview status (preview): Qualtrics records data when you preview your survey before deploying it. You probably always want to remove preview data.\nSurvey progress (progress): Qualtrics tracks how much of the survey the respondent completes. excluder can detect surveys which are incomplete.\nSurvey completion time (duration): Qualtrics records the number of seconds that the respondent works on the survey. excluder can detect completion times that are too fast or that take too long.\nIP address country (ip)*: If IP addresses are collected, they can determine the country of origin for the respondent. excluder can detect IP addresses outside of a specified country. Note, however, that VPNs can use IP addresses outside of the country of origin, so you must weigh the possibility of false alarms in detecting IP addresses from other countries.\nGeolocation in US (location)*: Qualtrics determines geolocation (latitude and longitude) through GPS or IP addresses. excluder can detect locations within the United States but cannot detect this for other countries at the moment.\nDuplicate IP address (duplicates)*: Automated bots may spam your survey from the same IP address. excluder detects if the same IP address shows up repeatedly in your data. Note, however, that duplicate IP addresses may be legitimately different respondents using the same computer or recycled dynamic IP address in the same household, dormitory, or business. So you must weigh the costs of losing good data against the benefits of removing bad data.\nScreen resolution (resolution)**: Sometimes, you may request that respondents use a particular kind of device for your survey, such as a desktop computer rather than a phone or tablet. excluder can assess screen resolution to detect respondents who may be using the wrong type of device.\n\n* You must have enabled non-anonymized data in Qualtrics to collect these metadata.\n** You must have included the computer metadata question in Qualtrics to collect these metadata.\n\n\nMarking rows\nOK, now that we know what kind of metadata we can work with, what do we do with them? The excluder package can do three actions on the metadata: mark, check, or exclude. The mark functions are the backbone of the package. Mark functions make new columns with the metadata criteria output appended to the existing data frame. So you pass a data frame to the mark functions to see which rows meet the metadata criteria. Mark function names simple prepend mark_ to the metadata tag. So, for example, the function that marks preview metadata (preview) is mark_preview().\nBefore we start marking, let’s look at an example data set that we can work with. The qualtrics_text data set includes both non-anonymous and computer metadata. We’ll just look at the first six rows by piping to head().\n\nlibrary(excluder)\nqualtrics_text %&gt;%\n  head()\n\n            StartDate             EndDate         Status    IPAddress Progress\n1 2020-12-11 12:06:52 2020-12-11 12:10:30 Survey Preview         &lt;NA&gt;      100\n2 2020-12-11 12:06:43 2020-12-11 12:11:27 Survey Preview         &lt;NA&gt;      100\n3 2020-12-11 12:17:22 2020-12-11 12:21:41     IP Address   73.23.43.0      100\n4 2020-12-11 12:17:41 2020-12-11 12:22:07     IP Address 16.140.105.0      100\n5 2020-12-11 12:19:45 2020-12-11 12:23:16     IP Address 107.57.244.0      100\n6 2020-12-11 12:37:51 2020-12-11 12:43:09     IP Address 15.232.167.0      100\n  Duration (in seconds) Finished        RecordedDate        ResponseId\n1                   465     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:10:30 R_xLWiuPaNuURSFXY\n2                   545     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:11:27 R_Q5lqYw6emJQZx2o\n3                   651     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:21:42 R_fbYBeNscosfzN9L\n4                   409     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:22:07 R_yyG1HGXOMNPfWDn\n5                   140     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:23:16 R_9dnzH1VI9mf8gle\n6                   213     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:43:09 R_1BoPF5igdMw536H\n  LocationLatitude LocationLongitude UserLanguage Browser      Version\n1         29.73694         -94.97599           EN  Chrome 88.0.4324.41\n2         39.74107        -121.82490           EN  Chrome 88.0.4324.50\n3         34.03852        -118.25739           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.88\n4         44.96581         -93.07187           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.88\n5         27.98064         -82.78531           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.88\n6         29.76499         -95.36156           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.88\n  Operating System Resolution\n1  Windows NT 10.0   1366x768\n2        Macintosh  1680x1050\n3  Windows NT 10.0   1366x768\n4  Windows NT 10.0   1536x864\n5  Windows NT 10.0   1536x864\n6  Windows NT 10.0   1366x768\n\n\nBy looking at the Status column, we can already see that the first two rows are previews.

First, we have an informational message telling us that 2 rows were collected as previews. Each mark function will output this kind of message letting us know how many rows meet each metadata criterion. Second, we now have a new column called exclusion_preview appended to the data frame. Notice that the first two rows of that column have preview values while the rest of the rows are blank. We have now marked which rows meet this metadata criterion. ☑️\nOf course, you may want to mark your data for multiple metadata criteria. To do this, you simply have to connect multiple mark functions with a pipe (either base R’s |&gt; or magrittr’s %&gt;%). So if we want to mark preview data and all rows where the completion duration is less than 200 seconds or more than 600 seconds, we just chain these together. In fact, we can also pull the data frame out of functions as well. Note that for clarity, I use the select() function from dplyr to show just a subset of columns and rows.\n\nqualtrics_text %&gt;%\n  mark_preview() %&gt;%\n  mark_duration(min_duration = 200, max_duration = 600) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(Status, `Duration (in seconds)`, exclusion_preview, exclusion_duration) %&gt;%\n  head()\n\nℹ 2 rows were collected as previews. It is highly recommended to exclude these rows before further processing.\n\n\nℹ 23 out of 100 rows took less time than 200.\n\n\nℹ 8 out of 100 rows took more time than 600.\n\n\n          Status Duration (in seconds) exclusion_preview exclusion_duration\n1 Survey Preview                   465           preview                   \n2 Survey Preview                   545           preview                   \n3     IP Address                   651                        duration_slow\n4     IP Address                   409                                     \n5     IP Address                   140                       duration_quick\n6     IP Address                   213                                     \n\n\nNow we have three messages regarding rows that meet the criteria: one for previews, one for short completion times, and one for long completion times. We also now have a new exclusion_duration column added that marks rows that are too quick or too slow.\nYou can pipe together as many mark functions as you would like to get a feel for which data rows meet your different criteria. But adding a new column for each criterion can make it difficult to visualize everything together. If you want to combine all of your criteria into a single column, add the unite_exclusions() function at the end of the chain. Rows meeting multiple criteria will separate those criteria with commas.\n\nqualtrics_text %&gt;%\n  mark_preview() %&gt;%\n  mark_duration(min_duration = 200, max_duration = 600) %&gt;%\n  unite_exclusions() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(Status, `Duration (in seconds)`, exclusions) %&gt;%\n  head()\n\nℹ 2 rows were collected as previews.

The check functions help with this by extracting only the rows that meet the criterion. So you can view just the problematic data. Here we use check_progress() to extract the rows with progress percentages less than 100.\n\nqualtrics_text %&gt;%\n  check_progress() %&gt;%\n  head()\n\nℹ 6 out of 100 rows did not complete the study.\n\n\n            StartDate             EndDate     Status    IPAddress Progress\n1 2020-12-17 15:40:53 2020-12-17 15:43:25 IP Address   22.51.31.0       99\n2 2020-12-17 15:40:56 2020-12-17 15:46:23 IP Address 71.146.112.0        1\n3 2020-12-17 15:41:52 2020-12-17 15:46:37 IP Address   15.223.0.0       13\n4 2020-12-17 15:41:27 2020-12-17 15:46:45 IP Address  19.127.87.0       48\n5 2020-12-17 15:49:42 2020-12-17 15:51:50 IP Address 40.146.247.0        5\n6 2020-12-17 15:49:28 2020-12-17 15:55:06 IP Address   2.246.67.0       44\n  Duration (in seconds) Finished        RecordedDate        ResponseId\n1                   879    FALSE 2020-12-17 15:43:25 R_AkQyJypPyjgribz\n2                   627    FALSE 2020-12-17 15:46:23 R_1cvaTAoXO7XW1vi\n3                    40    FALSE 2020-12-17 15:46:37 R_Dx6w74UfhnGhAmj\n4                    74    FALSE 2020-12-17 15:46:46 R_ewyyOOPADLGo9xZ\n5                   307    FALSE 2020-12-17 15:51:50 R_HFKclPO5wWGNsFs\n6                   355    FALSE 2020-12-17 15:55:06 R_UfSQq1VXYkVcxdJ\n  LocationLatitude LocationLongitude UserLanguage Browser      Version\n1         37.28265        -120.50248           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.88\n2         34.03605        -117.04066           EN    &lt;NA&gt;         &lt;NA&gt;\n3         34.77804         -84.96198           DE  Chrome 83.0.4103.61\n4         33.66715        -117.82543           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.88\n5         29.29882         -81.04289           EN Firefox         81.0\n6         37.79058        -121.96737           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.67\n  Operating System Resolution\n1  Windows NT 10.0   1366x768\n2             &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;\n3  Windows NT 10.0   1366x768\n4  Windows NT 10.0   1188x668\n5  Windows NT 10.0   1366x768\n6        Macintosh   1280x800\n\n\nThe check functions are useful for viewing rows meeting individual criteria. But you probably do not want to pipe multiple check functions together because each function outputs only the subset of the data that meets that criterion.

    "text": "Conclusion\nBefore the fun part of analyzing data, we often need to perform some more tedious steps. The qualtRics package is a huge help in automating the import of data into R. As we learned in Part 1, after connecting to the Qualtrics API, we can quickly (and powerfully) import our Qualtrics data with the fetch_survey() function. Once those data are imported, we can use the excluder package to deal with potentially problematic online survey data based on respondent metadata, using the mark, check, and exclude functions. Then we can deidentify our data set before continuing to work with it or passing it on to others. Combined, these two packages can improve your data workflow by automating import and early cleaning processes, leaving the fun part of data processing up to you!\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Brooke Cagle on Unsplash.\nIf you have ideas for improvements to the excluder package or if you find bugs, please submit an issue on the excluder GitHub repo."

    "text": "What is impulsivity?\nImpulsivity is a concept that means a lot of things to different people. And it is particularly important in dogs. Being impulsive can mean that your dog is unable to stop themselves from doing something like chasing after a squirrel, barking at another dog walking by, rolling in the stinkiest junk they come across, or jumping into the pool any chance they get.\n\n\n\nDogs exhibit many different types of impulsivity. Sources: Michael Oxdine, Tamas Pap, Guillaume de Germain, Joshua McLaughlin\n\n\nBeing impulsive can also mean that your dog cannot wait for things. Does your dog start eating while you’re still pouring food into their bowl? Do they run into the door as you’re opening it to let them outside? Would they eat an entire bag of dog food if it were available?\nBeing impulsive can mean that your dog takes risks. A dog that comes home with a nose full of porcupine quills or claw marks raked across their nose from a close encounter with a neighborhood cat is showing impulsivity.\nFinally, being impulsive can mean that your dog is easily distracted. Rather than focusing attention on one thing, some dogs may lose their focus from one thing in their environment when something new appears. The classic joke of dogs stopping what they are doing the instant a squirrel is detected personifies this idea. Or maybe while they are supposed to be retrieving a ball, they stop and smell the flowers."

    "text": "Why is it important?\nImpulsivity is important in dogs because we often want them to resist temptation, wait for things, and avoid risks. In fact, many dog training programs focus specifically on impulse control. Certainly, for pet dogs this is important because we want them to be able to nicely interact with other dogs at the dog park or be friendly to a small child who may not know how to appropriately pet a dog.\n\n\n\nControlling impulsivity is important in may contexts for dogs. Sources: Sofia Shultz, Mohamed Nohassi, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, William Milliot\n\n\nControlling impulsivity is critical in working dogs, too. Detection dogs have a job to do and can’t be distracted by people walking by, potentially with yummy food to snatch. Likewise, herding dogs must focus on their task and avoid other distractions but also inhibit their strong prey drive to focus on herding and not capturing.\nIn short, impulsivity is often a problem behavior in dogs. Though there can be times when impulsivity is good, we often want dogs to have self-control."

    "section": "What did we do?",
    "text": "What did we do?\nSince it is so important in dogs, we were interested in whether impulsivity is a behavioral trait. That is, we wondered if dogs are consistently impulsive in different ways. Is a dog that can’t resist the temptation to roll in something also likely to take risks around bigger critters or dig through the trash? If impulsivity is a trait, then we should be able to screen for it and predict behavior in new contexts. Or develop training techniques that, when they work in one situation, should also apply to other situations.\nTo investigate this question, we didn’t run our own study. Instead, we scoured the scientific literature to find other studies that looked into this question. Then we combined all of these studies and ran some statistics to see if there was evidence across studies for impulsivity as a behavioral trait. We searched several databases and found almost 10,000 articles that mentioned dogs and impulsivity. We winnowed that down to 13 articles that actually collected data on different impulsivity tasks1 in the same dogs or a measure of the owner’s perceptions of their dog’s impulsivity2. That gave us 31 pairs of impulsivity tasks and 15 pairs of owner perception ratings and impulsivity tasks. This allowed us to answer two questions:\n\nAre dogs’ impulsivity levels related across tasks?\nAre dogs’ impulsivity levels in tasks related to owner perceptions of their impulsivity?"

Cells are divided into numbers of studies that measured both tasks in the same dogs. Green represents studies that showed relationships, and red represents studies finding no relationship.\n\n\nAcross the 15 task/owner perception pairs, there was a relationship in five of them. However, in all tasks that showed a relationship with owner perception, there were other studies that did not show a relationship.\n\n\n\nMatrix of observed relationships between behavioral tasks and owner perceptions of dog impulsivity. Cells are divided into numbers of studies that measured tasks and owner perceptions in the same dogs. Green represents studies that showed relationships, and red represents studies finding no relationship.\n\n\nFinally, we conducted a meta-analysis on one pair of tasks (Tasks 1B & 4) that had seven studies attempt to look for a relationship. Meta-analyses combined the effects in all of the studies to see if there is an overall effect. In each individual study, there was no relationship in performance between these tasks, and so there was no overall relationship either."

    "text": "What does this mean?\nLet’s go back to our original research questions.\n\nAre dogs’ impulsivity levels related across tasks?\n\n\nThere is not good evidence for relationships in performance across different tasks—even for relatively similar tasks.\n\n\nAre dogs’ impulsivity levels in tasks related to owner perceptions of their impulsivity?\n\n\nThere is more evidence for this, but it is still not very strong. Owner perception of dog impulsivity matched behavior in some tasks, but even in those cases there are contradictory findings in other studies\n\nSo in general, we don’t have a lot of strong evidence that impulsivity is a behavioral trait in dogs. But this may not be too problematic because we can see similar issues with impulsivity in humans. Instead of impulsivity being an overall trait, it makes sense that there may be multiple types of impulsivity (like defined in the first section). So we might not expect too many relationships across different categories of impulsivity. However, that does not explain why we don’t see stronger relationships between tasks in the same categories. Answering this question is going to require more studies or much larger studies."

    "section": "Why is it important?",
    "text": "Why is it important?\nMany areas of behavioral science are facing a reckoning about how we do research. As scientists, we want our work to be high quality in a number of ways:\n\nrigor—using strong methods that test what we want to test\nreproducibility—ensuring that our methods and analyses can be reproduced by other scientists\nreplicability—ensuring that our findings can be replicated by other scientists\nrobustness—ensuring that our findings are generalizable across a wide range of contexts\n\n\nRigor\nIf you talk with ten scientists, you’ll hear ten different opinions on how to run a study. ManyDog’s big team science approach takes advantage of this by having many scientists come together to develop research designs and methods. Using the collective wisdom of lots of smart people helps ensure the rigor of the methods used in the studies.\n\n\nReproducibility\nFor far too long, the descriptions of methods in scientific papers were too sparse, and important information such as the experimental materials, data, and analysis records were not published along with the scientific article. The open science movement has changed that by encouraging researchers to write thorough methods descriptions and post experimental materials, data, and analysis records with scientific publication or on separate (but linked) repositories such as the Open Science Framework. At ManyDogs, we embrace open science and try to ensure that our work is as reproducible as possible, so other scientists can take our materials and data and check our work…or expand on it.\n\n\nReplicability\nTo achieve replicable science, one of the best things that we can do is use large sample sizes to include all of the variability that we see in subjects. A small sample size can result in an unrepresentative sample that biases findings. Behavioral testing in dogs is time consuming, and typical sample sizes for behavioral studies often range from 20-50 dogs. Combining forces across labs allows us to test many more dogs than individual labs can. Collecting data on hundreds of dogs increases the chances that our findings are consistent and replicable.\n\n\nRobustness\nCollecting data in one lab from one population may not carry over into other locations and populations. Different labs have different procedures for how they do things. And sometimes those procedures might have unintended effects on findings. For instance, the gender of the experimenter can effect behavior and stress responses in rodent studies3, so a different gender composition across labs could influence results. One way to increase robustness of findings across labs and populations is to include lots of labs and populations all in the same study! That’s built into the big team science approach of collecting data across many research sites. So hopefully our findings are robust to population differences.\n\n\nUnique research questions\nIn addition to the many methodological benefits of big team science, there is one super important advantage to ManyDogs—we can ask unique research questions that we simply cannot address easily in individual labs. Any time we talk about dog behavior, the first question people ask is “Are there breed difference?”. This question is extremely difficult for a single lab to answer (at least for behavioral questions) because there are hundreds of breeds and most sample sizes are in the low dozens. So there’s often no way to directly address breed differences in single lab studies of behavior. But with ManyDogs, we have hundreds of dogs and can start to explore some questions about breed differences (though really thousands of dogs may be needed to get at breed effects well).\nAnother unique question that ManyDogs can address that is hard to address for individual labs is the effect of culture on dog behavior and cognition. Dogs are treated differently across and within countries. How owners treat their dogs could have direct effects on their behavior. Therefore, dogs living in different cultures could behave differently. We can directly test potential cultural differences in dog behavior by comparing data across labs in different countries—a bonus benefit of the international reach of ManyDogs.\n\n\n\nDogs and their owners.

ManyDogs 2 is currently in the methods development phase with data collection probably starting in 2025.\nAnother project that we’re super excited about is a big-big team science project. We mentioned before that there are other projects similar to ManyDogs that focus on babies, primates, birds, goats, and fish. Well, all of the groups (and more) have joined together in a ManyManys project that will collaborate across all of the labs in all of these projects. We will be testing dozens of species! ManyManys 1 will focus on reversal learning5 and is in the methods development phase.\nManyDogs and the other big team science projects are not meant to replace studies in individual labs. But they can offer unique opportunities to answer important questions with large sample sizes. For ManyDogs, this includes questions about dog behavior at a scale that is simply not feasible for most individual labs. We’re excited about the future of ManyDogs and canine behavioral science!"

After the animals acquire this association by reliably choosing the reinforced option, the contingencies switch (e.g., now green is reinforced but red isn’t). The question is how long does it take to learn the newly reversed contingency. Researchers may continue to reverse the learning contingencies to see if the animals catch on.

If you use online surveys and want to quickly exclude participants who log in from the wrong country, don’t complete the survey, complete the survey too quickly, use the wrong device type, etc., the excluder package makes this easier to do. This package was peer reviewed by rOpenSci.\n\nGetting started with excluder vignette\nrOpenSci tutorial blog post\nGitHub repo\nJournal of Open Source Software paper\n\n\n\nflashr\nThe flashr package creates flashcards for learning terms and descriptions to help learns remember R functions. The flashcard decks are built using reveal.js and are customizable by the user. I’ve created built-in decks for the chapters from R for Data Science, but users can create their own decks that draw from an extensive glossary of over 300 R functions.\n\n\n\n\nGetting started with flashr vignette\nBuilt-in flashr decks\nGitHub repo\n\n\n\ncocoon\nThe cocoon package flexibly formats statistical output in a way that can be inserted into R Markdown or Quarto documents.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: Cross-posted with rOpenSci blog.\nThe online survey system Qualtrics can be a great way to collect data from research participants, customers, and stakeholders. I use it frequently to conduct research studies with participants or just to poll students and collaborators. However, while Qualtrics makes survey design straightforward, once the data are collected, there is a lot of work to do. Fortunately, two R packages (qualtRics1 and excluder2) can make importing data and excluding low-quality data easier.\nDiscovering the qualtRics package has saved me a lot of time importing data. It also lets me create data pipelines for sensitive data by reading files directly into R without saving them locally until they’ve been deidentified. This way I don’t accidentally save personally identifiable information in a place that is not authorized for sensitive data.\nAfter importing data, there is often a lot of clean up that needs to happen, especially for online survey respondents. I developed the excluder package to help with removing data entries based on broad metadata such as response duration, respondent location, screen resolution, etc. Combining the qualtRics and excluder packages can help you deal with the tedious part of survey data and quickly get to the fun part of data analysis!\nPart 1 of this series will show you how to use qualtRics to import your data, and we’ll cover excluding your data with excluder in Part 2."

    "text": "Importing Qualtrics data into R\nIf you’ve worked with Qualtrics data before, you know you have to log into Qualtrics, navigate to the data section, wait for all of the data to be “re-indexed” for viewing, choose whether to export as numeric or character values, choose what type of file to export, download the data file, find the downloaded data file, change the name of the file to something comprehensible, and delete those first two obnoxious rows of metadata. 😮‍💨 Having to go through this process manually every time that you want to download Qualtrics data can be cumbersome and time consuming.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: @corsairgaming at Giphy\nEnter, the qualtRics package from Julia Silge and Jasper Ginn3. This package allows you to use the Qualtrics API to directly connect to your survey data. You can download a list of surveys in your account, as well as the actual questions and metadata about those questions. But, most importantly, the qualtRics package allows you to download Qualtrics data into your R session. Therefore, you can write scripts that automatically import your Qualtrics data whenever you run your script. No more time wasted downloading manually!\n\nConnecting to Qualtrics\nOf course, to get your data, you have to have access to your Qualtrics account. The Qualtrics API allows you to connect to your Qualtrics account with your personal API token (or key) and your datacenter ID. You can find your API token by logging into Qualtrics, going to Account Settings, selecting the Qualtrics IDs tab, finding the API box, clicking Generate Token, and copying the long string of random letters and numbers shown next to Token. Note this key is like your password for accessing your account, so don’t share it with others. 🤫\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Qualtrics API Documentation\nFor your datacenter ID, follow the same procedure but look in the User box of the Qualtrics ID page and grab the Datacenter ID.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Qualtrics API Documentation\nYour datacenter ID can now be appended before qualtrics.com to generate your base URL: yourdatacenterid.qualtrics.com (don’t include https://). You can use the qualtRics function qualtrics_api_credentials() to connect your R session to the Qualtrics API.\n\nlibrary(qualtRics)\n\nqualtrics_api_credentials(api_key = \"&lt;YOUR-QUALTRICS_API_TOKEN&gt;\", \n                          base_url = \"&lt;YOUR-QUALTRICS_BASE_URL&gt;\")\n\nNow your R session should have access to your Qualtrics account. But if you start a new R session, you’ll have to rerun this command. And it is not recommended to save this command in an R script because, if you send the script to someone else or post it publicly in a repository, you are granting access to your Qualtrics account to other people. 😬\nTo avoid having to rerun the command, you can store your API token and base URL on your local computer by using install = TRUE. Including this argument will save the API token and base URL information in your .Renviron file, which is read when starting every new R session.\n\nqualtrics_api_credentials(api_key = \"&lt;YOUR-QUALTRICS_API_TOKEN&gt;\", \n                          base_url = \"&lt;YOUR-QUALTRICS_BASE_URL&gt;\",\n                          install = TRUE)\n\nNow you’ll either need to restart your R session or reload your environment with readRenviron(\"~/.Renviron\") to make the credentials accessible in the current R session.\nIf you use install = TRUE, this means that your credentials are stored in a plain text file on your computer. So this may not be something that you want to do on a shared computer account. You must decide between the security of not storing credentials on your computer and the convenience of not having to enter your credentials for every new R session. ⚖️\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Jeffrey Stevens built in Meme Generator\nCongrats—you’ve now registered your Qualtrics credentials! 🎉 If you have difficulty with this, check out the qualtRics documentation or GitHub issues, or the Qualtrics API documentation. If you have multiple Qualtrics accounts that you want you use, you’ll have to get creative about how you set up your API tokens.\n\n\nListing your surveys\nNow that you’ve connected to your Qualtrics account, one of the first things you may want to do is list the surveys that you have in your account. While you can do this by hand through the Qualtrics website, you can also download a list of all surveys as a data frame with all_surveys().\n\nsurveys &lt;- all_surveys() \n\nYou can then view data frame to find the survey that you want.\n\nView(surveys)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Jeffrey Stevens”\nThe id column lists the survey ID for each survey (starting with SV_). This is a unique identifier that Qualtrics uses to label each survey. You will need the survey ID to download or work with it, so make sure to copy it from the data frame.\n\n\nImporting surveys\nNow that we know which survey we want, we can import it using fetch_survey() and the survey ID.\n\nmysurvey &lt;- fetch_survey(surveyID = \"SV_XXXXXXXXXX\")\n\nThis imports the survey as a data frame. The fetch_survey() function has many arguments that are helpful in importing your data. Here are just a few:\n\nSet your time zone with time_zone. This is important because, if you don’t set it in your Account Settings, Qualtrics has a default time zone that may differ from your own.\nExtract entries during a particular time period with start_date and/or end_date.\nImport only certain questions with include_questions.\nControl whether you import choice text or numeric data with label.\nLet the function try to guess the proper data types for your columns with convert or specify the data types with col_types.\nSave your data frame locally with the save_dir argument. Note it saves the file as an RDS file, so you’ll need something like readRDS() to read it.\n\nFind out more about this function in the fetch_survey() documentation.\nfetch_survey() allows you to automatically import your Qualtrics surveys directly—no more messy and time-consuming downloads! But if you’ve already downloaded a file from Qualtrics, you can use qualtRics’ read_survey() function to import that file and clean up some Qualtrics messiness like removing those first two obnoxious rows and allowing control over the time zone and column data types.\n\n\nViewing survey info\nWhile fetch_survey() provides the core functionality of the qualtRics package, the package also includes some other helper functions that allow you to view information about your survey.\nYou can get a data frame that includes all survey questions and their IDs and names with survey_questions(). To really drill down into your survey, use the metadata() function. Not only can you access general metadata about your survey (survey name, owner ID, organization ID, creation/modification dates), but you can get more detailed information about your questions (question labels, question type, response option descriptions), block information, and survey flow. You can access information about the survey distribution, mailing lists, etc. with other functions. It’s definitely worth exploring all of the helper functions."
