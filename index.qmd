I am a Susan J. Rosowski Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Center for Brain, Biology & Behavior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where I direct the [Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab](https://dogcog.unl.edu){target="_blank"}. I am also a Data Science Mentor at [Posit Academy](https://posit.co/academy){target="_blank"} (formerly RStudio).

My research program uses data science to understand decision making in humans and other animals. My research integrates perspectives from biology, psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and economics. I employ open science practices to ensure that my work is transparent, accessible, and reproducible.

I train the next generation of data scientists. As a professor, I have trained hundreds of undergraduates, graduate students, and even faculty in how to think about, analyze, visualize, and report their data. As a data science mentor at Posit, I do the same for corporate employees.
