## Thought Questions/Exercises

<details>

<summary> Chapter 1: Data sources </summary>

1. How is a relational database different from a spreadsheet? How are they similar?
1. When would you want to store data in a relational database rather than a spreadsheet?
1. What is the difference between a database and a schema?
1. What is a primary key? What is a foreign key?
1. What is the primary key for the `customer` table? What about the `market_date_info` table? What about the `customer_purchases` table?
1. What are three foreign keys in the `customer_purchases` table?

</details>


<details>

<summary> Chapter 2: The SELECT Statement </summary>

1. What are the two functions/statements required for all SQL queries?
1. Are SQL functions/statements case sensitive? Try a query using `SELECT`, `select`, `Select`, and `sElEcT`. Do they all work?
1. What is the role of spaces, line breaks, and tabs in SQL queries?
1. What two pieces of information do you need to use the `FROM` statement?
1. What is the default sorting order for `ORDER BY`?
1. Which statement returns only first N rows, where the user can specify the number N?
1. When you use `ROUND` to round a column of numbers, does that change the values in the original table?
1. What happens if you concatenate two columns without specifying a delimiter?
1. Write a query that combines the three columns of `vendor_booth_assignments` separated by underscores to create a column that is a primary key. Name that column `key`.

<summary> Chapter 3: The WHERE Clause </summary>

1. Under what circumstances would you put quotes around a number?
1. Let's say your `WHERE` statement has three conditional statements. How many conditional statements have to be TRUE to keep a row when using `AND`? What about when using `OR`?
1. If you want to use a `WHERE` statement to subset rows for _customer_ids_ 3 and 4, which logical operator should you use?
1. How do we specify the order of operations for evaluating conditional statements?
1. Return a subset of the _customer_purchases_ table for transactions involving more than 15 items purchased.
1. Return a subset of the _customer_purchases_ for customer ids 2-5 using three different techniques.
1. Why does this statement not work? `WHERE customer_id = NULL`
1. What is a subquery?
