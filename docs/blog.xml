<p>We recently published a <a href="../../pubs/deboer_etal_2025.pdf">paper</a> in <em>Psychological Topics</em> that describes our most recent study conducted at the Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab (CCHIL). Undergraduates Hunter DeBoer and Hannah Fitzpatrick led this project under the supervision of graduate students Anwyn Gatesy-Davis and London Wolff. This work was conducted in collaboration with <a href="https://www.upliftingpaws.org/">Uplifting Paws</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-quantification">What is quantification?</h2>
<p><em>Quantification</em> is the ability to track quantities of objects in your environment. As humans, we can count individual objects that we perceive, such as eggs in an Easter basket or chimes from a clock. But other species likely do not have words or symbols to represent the number of objects. Instead, they likely compare overall quantities of things that they observe in their environments.</p>

</div>
<p>Animal researchers have investigated how many different species quantify lots of different things in their environments. An important question that they’ve asked is <em>how</em> animals compare quantities.</p>
<p>One of the classic explanations of how animals compare quantities is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law">Weber’s Law</a>, which says that the ability to distinguish between two quantities depends on the <strong>numerical ratio</strong> between the two numbers. For example, the ratio between the numbers 1 and 2 is 1/2 or 0.5. This shares the same ratio as other number pairs like 2 and 4 or 10 and 20.</p>
<p>Weber’s Law states that you will be able to distinguish quantities at the same level if they have the same ratio. So, for instance, in the top panel of the following image, one of the sides (a or b) has 24 dots and the other has 25 dots. In the bottom panel, one side has 48 dots and the other has 50 dots. Can you tell which has more (without counting them)? In both cases, the ratio between the quantities is 0.96 (both 24/25 and 48/50 = 0.96). Therefore, your probability of correctly guessing which group (a or b) has more dots on the top panel should be about the same as the dots on the bottom because they share the same ratio. This is Weber’s Law.</p>

</section>
<section id="why-is-it-important" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Quantification is important to animals because they often need to decide whether to hunt a larger or smaller group of prey. They also might need to decide whether to fight or flee a rival group depending on whether the other group has fewer or more members than their own.</p>
<p>At CCHIL, we study dogs, and quantification is important for them, too. For example, herding dogs need to keep their livestock together. If the stock break into two groups, the herding dogs need to decide which group is smaller because it will be easier to herd a smaller group into the larger than vice versa.</p>
<p>We studied dog quantification in the context of food. We expect that in general dogs prefer more over less food. Over the course of their domestication in the last 15,000 or more years, we expect that dogs who could accurately pick more over less food would be more likely to survive and reproduce than the less accurate dogs. So dogs should have a strong <em>preference</em> for more food when they can tell the difference between quantities. Now we just had to see if the ratio between quantities determined their preferences, as predicted by Weber’s Law.</p>
<p>Other studies have already shown that numerical ratio predicts quantity preferences in dogs. However, those studies did not test whether other factors, such as the <strong>numerical difference</strong> between quantities could also predict preference. Numerical difference is simply subtracting the quantities instead of dividing them. So the numerical difference between 1 and 2 is 1 (2 - 1 = 1). Numerical difference is important is human judgments about quantities<sup>1</sup>, but, prior to this study, we didn’t know if difference is also important in dog quantity preferences.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-did-we-do" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?</h2>
<p>We were interested in whether ratio, difference, or both influenced dog’s ability to quantify objects. To test this, we conducted a <em>quantity preference task</em> where we presented subjects with two quantities of treats and let them pick and eat one of the two quantities.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/posts/dog_number/images/preference_stim.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Overhead view of two plates of treats with two treats on the left plate and four treats on the right plate."></p>
<figcaption>We offered dogs plates with different quantities of treats on them. Dogs could only eat the first quantity that they picked.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We created 9 different <em>numerical pairs</em> of treats that varied in their ratio and difference. Subjects experienced 10 experimental sessions where they chose between each of the 9 numerical pairs. Seven dogs completed all of these sessions. With this, we could test our research question of whether ratio, difference, or both predicted dog quantity preferences.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-did-we-find" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-did-we-find">What did we find?</h2>
<p>We found that both ratio and difference were associated with quantity preference. Dogs preferred the larger quantity more when the ratio was small and the difference was large.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/posts/dog_number/images/hypothesis1.1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Two-panel figure showing mean percent choice for larger quantity as a function of numerical difference (left panel) and numerical ratio (right panel). Figure shows individual dog responses as lines and mean and 95% confidence intervals as dogs and error bars. Mean choice increases with difference and decreases with ratio."></p>
<figcaption>Dogs chose the larger quantities more as difference increased and ratio decreased.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>However, ratio and difference are <em>confounded</em>, which means that they are not completely independent. As you change one, you will also change the other. This suggests that we need to do some additional analyses to disentangle whether ratio affects quantity preference <em>independent of difference</em> and whether difference affects quantity preference <em>independent of ratio</em>. After running this analysis, we found that <strong>only difference predicted quantity preferences</strong> when ratio was held constant.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/posts/dog_number/images/ratio_diff.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Three-panel figure showing mean percent choice for larger quantity as a function of numerical difference with each panel representing one ratio: 0.33, 0.50, and 0.67. Figure shows individual dog responses as lines and mean and 95% confidence intervals as dogs and error bars. Mean choice increases with difference in all three panels."></p>
<figcaption>Within ratios, we still see difference influencing quantity preferences. But within differences, we do not see ratios influencing quantity preferences.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</section>
<section id="what-does-this-mean" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>
<p>When we hold difference constant, ratio does not predict quantity preference. However, when we hold ratio constant, difference <em>does</em> predict quantity preference. So, we found that <strong>difference does a better job than ratio of accounting for quantification in dogs</strong>.</p>
<p>This was a surprising finding since other studies show ratio effects on quanitification. But those studies did not properly account for difference as a factor influencing quantification. To check whether our results applied to other studies, we ran our same analyses on data sets from two other studies. In both cases, difference accounted for quantification, and ratio did not<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>So across three data sets, we see that difference drives dog quantity preferences. While this doesn’t completely undermine Weber’s Law, it does suggest that we need to investigate Weber’s Law more carefully to figure out when it does and doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>For dog owners, this means that cutting up those treats into smaller pieces may actually trick your dog into thinking they’re getting more!</strong></p>

  <title>flashr: Create Flashcards of Terms and Definitions</title>
  <dc:creator>Jeffrey Stevens</dc:creator>
  <link>https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/posts/flashr/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Are you learning R? Or teaching it? There are <strong>a lot</strong> of functions to keep track of. That’s why I developed the <a href="https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/flashr/"><code>{flashr}</code></a> package.</p>
<p>As an R user in the field of psychology, I was excited to read <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain"><em>The Programmer’s Brain</em></a> by Felienne Hermans because of the subtitle: “What every programmer needs to know about cognition”. This book applies what we know about cognitive psychology to coding.</p>
<p><img src="https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/posts/flashr/images/programmers_brain.jpg" alt="Cover of The Programmer's Brain book." width="200" class="center"></p>
<p>There are many gems in the book. But one of the things that stuck with me was the suggestion that flashcards could be useful in learning coding by giving repetitive experience with terms and their definitions. This inspired me to create <code>{flashr}</code> to generate flashcards. With <code>{flashr}</code> you can create flashcard slides from existing decks or from data frames of your own terms and descriptions. The slides can be viewed in the RStudio viewer or saved as HTML files.</p>
<section id="building-decks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-decks">Building decks</h2>
<p>Let’s say you or your students are learning R by reading <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/"><em>R for Data Science</em></a> (R4DS)<sup>1</sup>. In chapter 1 on data visualization, there are 14 functions referenced. Once you move on to chapter 3 on data transformation, there are 31 functions, 25 of which are new. By chapter 5, there are about 60 functions to know. That’s a lot! And some of them sound quite similar. Does <code>dplyr::select()</code> subset rows or columns? What about <code>dplyr::filter()</code>?</p>
<p>Keeping track of all of the new functions can be tricky. But flashcards can help. And if you’re using R4DS, you’re in luck because we’ve already created flashcards for each chapter in the book. And they’re baked into <code>{flashr}</code>. All you have to do is find the tag that references the chapter of interest and pass it to the <code>flashcard()</code> function. So if you want to build a flashcard deck of the functions referenced in the first chapter of R4DS, just type:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<section id="finding-decks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-decks">Finding decks</h2>
<p>Where did <code>"r4ds-2e01"</code> come from? It’s a tag that represents the first chapter of the second edition of R4DS. To find it, you just have to list available flashcard decks with the <code>list_decks()</code> function. There are a lot of decks, so it helps to narrow down the list by using some pattern matching. For instance, if you’re interested in using chapters from the second edition of R4DS, you might try matching <code>"2e"</code> to focus only on that edition of the book.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="customizing-decks">Customizing decks</h2>
<p>One of the great things about flashcards is that you can either view terms and guess descriptions or view descriptions and guess terms. By default, <code>flashcard()</code> builds decks where you have to guess the descriptions from the terms. But you can easily switch that around with the <code>termsfirst = FALSE</code> argument.</p>

<p>The <code>{flashr}</code> package was first published on CRAN in 2023. But version 0.2.0 includes functions that can help you build your own decks. What if there are other books besides R4DS or the PsyTeachR series that you want to build decks from? Do you have to go through and find all of the individual functions and write out all of the descriptions for those other books? Ugh…that sounds awful!</p>
<p>Well, maybe we can help. The <code>extract_code()</code> function lets you extract the contents of code blocks from R Markdown and Quarto documents. That can then be passed to <code>extract_functions()</code> to pull out all of the functions in that code. Once you have a vector of functions, they can be passed to <code>build_functions_df()</code> which makes a flashr-friendly data frame and even pulls descriptions from functions that are included in the <a href="https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/flashr_decks/functions.html">flashr decks list of functions</a>. Let’s try that with chapter 3 of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/adv-r/refs/heads/master/Names-values.Rmd">Advanced R</a>.</p>

<p>Notice that, though “extract_code” is in our vector of functions, it does not show up in the data frame. That is because the <code>extract_code()</code> function is not in the <a href="https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/flashr_decks/functions.html">flashr decks list of functions</a>, so it does not have a description or package associated with it. If I want to include it in the data frame anyways (along with any other functions not on the list), I can just set <code>omit = FALSE</code> to include terms with missing descriptions. This could be useful if you want to export your data frame and fill in your own descriptions.</p>

<p>CCHIL is elated to be part of a very exciting initiative called the <a href="http://manydogs.org">ManyDogs Project</a> that brings together dog behavior and cognition labs worldwide together to study canine science. We have a <a href="https://doi.org/10.3819/CCBR.2023.180004">paper</a> published in <em>Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews</em> that introduces this initiative, but here we give a quick summary.</p>
<section id="what-is-the-manydogs-project" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-the-manydogs-project">What is the ManyDogs Project?</h2>
<p>ManyDogs is a collaboration between dog behavior and cognition labs worldwide interested in running the same studies across sites. It’s an example of <em>big team science</em>, or “collaborations wherein a comparatively large number of researchers pool their intellectual and/or material resources to pursue a common goal”<sup>1</sup>. There are similar groups that study <a href="https://manybabies.org/">babies</a>, <a href="https://manyprimates.github.io/">primates</a>, <a href="https://themanybirds.com/">birds</a>, <a href="https://www.themanygoatsproject.com/">goats</a>, and <a href="https://themanyfishes.github.io/">fish</a>.</p>
<p>ManyDogs kicked off at a <a href="https://comparativecognition.org/">Comparative Cognition Society Conference</a>, where a number of canine researchers got together to talk about joining forces to collect data together. CCHIL was invited to join in March 2020 (yes, that March 2020)—we readily agreed and haven’t looked back since. While starting off with just a handful of labs, we now boast more than 25 participating sites and are intent to keep growing!</p>

</section>
<section id="what-do-we-do" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-do-we-do">What do we do?</h2>
<p>Our first order of business was to recruit research sites into our collaboration. This allowed us to build a core group of researchers interested in leading ManyDogs as an organization and growing the research sites to include labs from all over the world. The ManyDogs <a href="https://manydogsproject.github.io/leadership.html">leadership team</a> works to build our community, maintain our data management infrastructure, and monitor the selection of research projects.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the key function of ManyDogs, which is to organize and support research projects. This involves selecting projects, developing methods, organizing data collection across research sites, analyzing data across sites, publishing scientific papers, and archiving materials and data from projects.</p>
<p>Our first project (<a href="https://manydogsproject.github.io/manydogs1.html">ManyDogs 1</a>) was completed and published in 2023. It focused on how dogs follow human point gestures<sup>2</sup>. We have survey data from over 700 dogs and behavioral data from over 450 dogs. I’d say that was a success!</p>
</section>
<section id="why-is-it-important" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Many areas of behavioral science are facing a reckoning about how we do research. As scientists, we want our work to be high quality in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>rigor—using strong methods that test what we want to test</li>
<li>reproducibility—ensuring that our methods and analyses can be reproduced by other scientists</li>
<li>replicability—ensuring that our findings can be replicated by other scientists</li>
<li>robustness—ensuring that our findings are generalizable across a wide range of contexts</li>
</ul>
<section id="rigor" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rigor">Rigor</h3>
<p>If you talk with ten scientists, you’ll hear ten different opinions on how to run a study. ManyDog’s big team science approach takes advantage of this by having many scientists come together to develop research designs and methods. Using the collective wisdom of lots of smart people helps ensure the rigor of the methods used in the studies.</p>
</section>
<section id="reproducibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h3>
<p>For far too long, the descriptions of methods in scientific papers were too sparse, and important information such as the experimental materials, data, and analysis records were not published along with the scientific article. The <em>open science</em> movement has changed that by encouraging researchers to write thorough methods descriptions and post experimental materials, data, and analysis records with scientific publication or on separate (but linked) repositories such as the <a href="https://osf.io">Open Science Framework</a>. At ManyDogs, we embrace open science and try to ensure that our work is as reproducible as possible, so other scientists can take our materials and data and check our work…or expand on it.</p>
</section>
<section id="replicability" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="replicability">Replicability</h3>
<p>To achieve replicable science, one of the best things that we can do is use large sample sizes to include all of the variability that we see in subjects. A small sample size can result in an unrepresentative sample that biases findings. Behavioral testing in dogs is time consuming, and typical sample sizes for behavioral studies often range from 20-50 dogs. Combining forces across labs allows us to test many more dogs than individual labs can. Collecting data on hundreds of dogs increases the chances that our findings are consistent and replicable.</p>
</section>
<section id="robustness" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="robustness">Robustness</h3>
<p>Collecting data in one lab from one population may not carry over into other locations and populations. Different labs have different procedures for how they do things. And sometimes those procedures might have unintended effects on findings. For instance, the gender of the experimenter can effect behavior and stress responses in rodent studies<sup>3</sup>, so a different gender composition across labs could influence results. One way to increase robustness of findings across labs and populations is to include lots of labs and populations all in the same study! That’s built into the big team science approach of collecting data across many research sites. So hopefully our findings are robust to population differences.</p>
</section>
<section id="unique-research-questions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unique-research-questions">Unique research questions</h3>
<p>In addition to the many methodological benefits of big team science, there is one super important advantage to ManyDogs—we can ask unique research questions that we simply cannot address easily in individual labs. Any time we talk about dog behavior, the first question people ask is “Are there breed difference?”. This question is extremely difficult for a single lab to answer (at least for behavioral questions) because there are hundreds of breeds and most sample sizes are in the low dozens. So there’s often no way to directly address breed differences in single lab studies of behavior. But with ManyDogs, we have hundreds of dogs and can start to explore some questions about breed differences (though really thousands of dogs may be needed to get at breed effects well).</p>
<p>Another unique question that ManyDogs can address that is hard to address for individual labs is the effect of culture on dog behavior and cognition. Dogs are treated differently across and within countries. How owners treat their dogs could have direct effects on their behavior. Therefore, dogs living in different cultures could behave differently. We can directly test potential cultural differences in dog behavior by comparing data across labs in different countries—a bonus benefit of the international reach of ManyDogs.</p>

<section id="whats-next" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Since ManyDogs 1 is complete, we have moved on to ManyDogs 2, which will focus on overimitation<sup>4</sup>. ManyDogs 2 is currently in the methods development phase with data collection probably starting in 2025.</p>
<p>Another project that we’re super excited about is a <strong>big</strong>-big team science project. We mentioned before that there are other projects similar to ManyDogs that focus on <a href="https://manybabies.org/">babies</a>, <a href="https://manyprimates.github.io/">primates</a>, <a href="https://themanybirds.com/">birds</a>, <a href="https://www.themanygoatsproject.com/">goats</a>, and <a href="https://themanyfishes.github.io/">fish</a>. Well, all of the groups (and more) have joined together in a <a href="https://manymanys.github.io/">ManyManys</a> project that will collaborate across all of the labs in all of these projects. We will be testing dozens of species! ManyManys 1 will focus on reversal learning<sup>5</sup> and is in the methods development phase.</p>
<p>ManyDogs and the other big team science projects are not meant to replace studies in individual labs. But they can offer unique opportunities to answer important questions with large sample sizes. For ManyDogs, this includes questions about dog behavior at a scale that is simply not feasible for most individual labs. We’re excited about the future of ManyDogs and canine behavioral science!</p>

<p>We recently had a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/com0000352">paper</a> published in <em>Journal of Comparative Psychology</em> that was a systematic review and meta-analysis on whether impulsivity is a behavioral trait in dogs. This work was conducted with Jessica Barela and Yasmine Worth and was selected as an <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/editors-choice">APA Editor’s Choice</a> article.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-impulsivity">What is impulsivity?</h2>
<p><em>Impulsivity</em> is a concept that means a lot of things to different people. And it is particularly important in dogs. Being impulsive can mean that your dog is <strong><em>unable to stop themselves</em></strong> from doing something like chasing after a squirrel, barking at another dog walking by, rolling in the stinkiest junk they come across, or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/entertainment/2024/03/21/bad-dog-in-pool-moos-cprog-orig-bdk.cnn">jumping into the pool any chance they get</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Being impulsive can also mean that your dog <strong><em>cannot wait for things</em></strong>. Does your dog start eating while you’re still pouring food into their bowl? Do they run into the door as you’re opening it to let them outside? Would they eat an entire bag of dog food if it were available?</p>
<p>Being impulsive can mean that your dog <strong><em>takes risks</em></strong>. A dog that comes home with a nose full of porcupine quills or claw marks raked across their nose from a close encounter with a neighborhood cat is showing impulsivity.</p>
<p>Finally, being impulsive can mean that your dog is <strong><em>easily distracted</em></strong>. Rather than focusing attention on one thing, some dogs may lose their focus from one thing in their environment when something new appears. The classic joke of dogs stopping what they are doing the instant a squirrel is detected personifies this idea. Or maybe while they are supposed to be retrieving a ball, they stop and smell the flowers.</p>

<section id="why-is-it-important" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Impulsivity is important in dogs because we often want them to resist temptation, wait for things, and avoid risks. In fact, many dog training programs focus specifically on impulse control. Certainly, for pet dogs this is important because we want them to be able to nicely interact with other dogs at the dog park or be friendly to a small child who may not know how to appropriately pet a dog.</p>

</div>
<p>Controlling impulsivity is critical in working dogs, too. Detection dogs have a job to do and can’t be distracted by people walking by, potentially with yummy food to snatch. Likewise, herding dogs must focus on their task and avoid other distractions but also inhibit their strong prey drive to focus on herding and not capturing.</p>
<p>In short, impulsivity is often a problem behavior in dogs. Though there can be times when impulsivity is good, we often want dogs to have <em>self-control</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-did-we-do" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?</h2>
<p>Since it is so important in dogs, we were interested in whether impulsivity is a <em>behavioral trait</em>. That is, we wondered if dogs are consistently impulsive in different ways. Is a dog that can’t resist the temptation to roll in something also likely to take risks around bigger critters or dig through the trash? If impulsivity is a trait, then we should be able to screen for it and predict behavior in new contexts. Or develop training techniques that, when they work in one situation, should also apply to other situations.</p>
<p>To investigate this question, we didn’t run our own study. Instead, we scoured the scientific literature to find other studies that looked into this question. Then we combined all of these studies and ran some statistics to see if there was evidence across studies for impulsivity as a behavioral trait. We searched several databases and found almost 10,000 articles that mentioned dogs and impulsivity. We winnowed that down to 13 articles that actually collected data on different impulsivity tasks<sup>1</sup> in the same dogs or a measure of the owner’s perceptions of their dog’s impulsivity<sup>2</sup>. That gave us 31 pairs of impulsivity tasks and 15 pairs of owner perception ratings and impulsivity tasks. This allowed us to answer two questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Are dogs’ impulsivity levels related across tasks?</li>
<li>Are dogs’ impulsivity levels in tasks related to owner perceptions of their impulsivity?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="what-did-we-find" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-did-we-find">What did we find?</h2>
<p>Across the 31 impulsivity task pairs, there was a relationship between tasks in only <strong>three</strong> of them. One of those relationships was between two very similar tasks (though another study did not find a relationship between the same tasks, and it had a larger sample size).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<figcaption>Matrix of observed relationships between different behavioral tasks. Cells are divided into numbers of studies that measured both tasks in the same dogs. Green represents studies that showed relationships, and red represents studies finding no relationship.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Across the 15 task/owner perception pairs, there was a relationship in <strong>five</strong> of them. However, in all tasks that showed a relationship with owner perception, there were other studies that did not show a relationship.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Matrix of observed relationships between behavioral tasks and owner perceptions of dog impulsivity. Cells are divided into numbers of studies that measured tasks and owner perceptions in the same dogs. Green represents studies that showed relationships, and red represents studies finding no relationship.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Finally, we conducted a meta-analysis on one pair of tasks (Tasks 1B &amp; 4) that had seven studies attempt to look for a relationship. Meta-analyses combined the effects in all of the studies to see if there is an overall effect. In each individual study, there was no relationship in performance between these tasks, and so there was no overall relationship either.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-does-this-mean" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>
<p>Let’s go back to our original research questions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Are dogs’ impulsivity levels related across tasks?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There is not good evidence for relationships in performance across different tasks—even for relatively similar tasks.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Are dogs’ impulsivity levels in tasks related to owner perceptions of their impulsivity?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There is more evidence for this, but it is still not very strong. Owner perception of dog impulsivity matched behavior in some tasks, but even in those cases there are contradictory findings in other studies</li>
</ul>
<p>So in general, <strong>we don’t have a lot of strong evidence that impulsivity is a behavioral trait in dogs</strong>. But this may not be too problematic because we can see similar issues with impulsivity in humans. Instead of impulsivity being an overall trait, it makes sense that there may be multiple types of impulsivity (like defined in the first section). So we might not expect too many relationships across different categories of impulsivity. However, that does not explain why we don’t see stronger relationships between tasks in the same categories. Answering this question is going to require more studies or much larger studies.</p>

  <title>Working with Qualtrics Data - Part 2: Excluding Data</title>
  <dc:creator>Jeffrey Stevens</dc:creator>
  <link>https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/posts/ropensci_excluder/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>Note: Cross-posted with <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2022/08/09/working-with-qualtrics-data-excluding/">rOpenSci blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="../../blog/2022/08/02/working-with-qualtrics-data-importing/">last post</a>, we used the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/">qualtRics</a><sup>1</sup> package to import survey data directly from <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a> accounts. I often use Qualtrics for survey data collected via <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Amazon’s Mechanical Turk</a>, which is an automated system that connects online respondents to paid surveys. However, sometimes those data are not super useful because the quality of the data is poor. In the anonymous, large-scale market of online survey respondents, the financial incentives for completing surveys attract respondents who blast through the study just to collect the money or, worse, automated bots programmed to act like humans and reap the incentives. 🤖 As a scientist, I’m collecting survey data to understand human nature, so I’m looking for honest responses. But low-quality data can be common in online surveys, and not just on Mechanical Turk<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>There are some cues that data may come from bots, such as entries originating from outside of your specified country or multiple entries coming from the same IP address. Cues of inattentive human participants include not completing the survey, completing it very quickly or slowly, or ignoring your requests to use specific types of devices (e.g., desktop computers not phones or tablets). I call these kinds of cues <em>metadata</em> because they are not direct responses from the respondents but are information about <em>how</em> the respondent took the survey. After repeatedly creating filters to deal with these problematic metadata, I formalized them into my first R package called <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/excluder/">excluder</a><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>In Part 2 of this series, we’ll use excluder to remove potentially problematic metadata. First, we’ll learn how to set up your Qualtrics survey to collect the relevant information. Then we’ll learn how to mark, check, and exclude observations based on the metadata. Finally, we’ll clean up our data sets by deidentifying them.</p>
<section id="before-collecting-your-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="before-collecting-your-data">Before collecting your data</h2>
<p>As a reminder, excluder focuses on <em>metadata</em> about an entry rather than the actual responses. If you have particular questions from your specific survey that you want to use to exclude data (for example, questions specifically designed to check the attentiveness of respondents), you should use regular subset/filter functions from <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/subset.html">base R</a> or <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">dplyr</a>. Here, we’re focusing on metadata collected about your survey respondents.</p>
<p>But to use this metadata, you must first collect it! Though the excluder package can work with metadata from other survey systems (e.g., SurveyMonkey), we’ll focus on data coming from Qualtrics surveys. There are two options in Qualtrics that allow you to collect the metadata that excluder can work with.</p>
<section id="anonymous-vs.-non-anonymous-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="anonymous-vs.-non-anonymous-data">Anonymous vs.&nbsp;non-anonymous data</h3>
<p>First, Qualtrics can collect either anonymous or non-anonymous data. Non-anonymous data include IP address, geolocation, and contact information provided by you (if you have Qualtrics email your respondents). To collect non-anonymous data, you must toggle the switch <em>Off</em> under <em>Survey</em> &gt; <em>Options</em> &gt; <em>Security</em> &gt; <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-options/survey-protection/#AnonymizingResponses"><em>Anonymize responses</em></a>. If you collect non-anonymous data, just make sure that respondents know that you’re collecting their IP address and location<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<section id="computer-metadata" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computer-metadata">Computer metadata</h3>
<p>In addition to IP address and location, Qualtrics can also collect information about the computer environment that respondents use to take your survey, such as operating system, browser type and version, and screen resolution. To collect the <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/advanced/meta-info-question/">computer metadata</a>, you must create a question in your survey in a block that already has another question. Click <em>Add a new question</em> and select the <em>Meta info</em> question type.</p>

<section id="removing-problematic-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="removing-problematic-data">Removing problematic data</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve collected the proper metadata, we can use it to deal with potentially problematic data.</p>
<section id="metadata" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metadata">Metadata</h3>
<p>Here are seven types of metadata that excluder works with, along with their tags that are used in excluder functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qualtrics preview status</strong> (<code>preview</code>): Qualtrics records data when you <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/preview-survey/">preview your survey</a> before deploying it. You probably always want to remove preview data.</li>
<li><strong>Survey progress</strong> (<code>progress</code>): Qualtrics tracks how much of the survey the respondent completes. excluder can detect surveys which are incomplete.</li>
<li><strong>Survey completion time</strong> (<code>duration</code>): Qualtrics records the number of seconds that the respondent works on the survey. excluder can detect completion times that are too fast or that take too long.</li>
<li><strong>IP address country</strong> (<code>ip</code>)<sup>*</sup>: If IP addresses are collected, they can determine the country of origin for the respondent. excluder can detect IP addresses outside of a specified country. Note, however, that VPNs can use IP addresses outside of the country of origin, so you must weigh the possibility of false alarms in detecting IP addresses from other countries.</li>
<li><strong>Geolocation in US</strong> (<code>location</code>)<sup>*</sup>: Qualtrics determines geolocation (latitude and longitude) through GPS or IP addresses. excluder can detect locations within the United States but cannot detect this for other countries at the moment.</li>
<li><strong>Duplicate IP address</strong> (<code>duplicates</code>)<sup>*</sup>: Automated bots may spam your survey from the same IP address. excluder detects if the same IP address shows up repeatedly in your data. Note, however, that duplicate IP addresses may be legitimately different respondents using the same computer or recycled dynamic IP address in the same household, dormitory, or business. So you must weigh the costs of losing good data against the benefits of removing bad data.</li>
<li><strong>Screen resolution</strong> (<code>resolution</code>)<sup>**</sup>: Sometimes, you may request that respondents use a particular kind of device for your survey, such as a desktop computer rather than a phone or tablet. excluder can assess screen resolution to detect respondents who may be using the wrong type of device.</li>
</ul>
<p><sup>*</sup> You must have enabled <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-options/survey-protection/#AnonymizingResponses">non-anonymized data</a> in Qualtrics to collect these metadata.</p>
<p><sup>**</sup> You must have included the <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/advanced/meta-info-question/">computer metadata question</a> in Qualtrics to collect these metadata.</p>
</section>
<section id="marking-rows" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="marking-rows">Marking rows</h3>
<p>OK, now that we know what kind of metadata we can work with, what do we do with them? The excluder package can do three actions on the metadata: mark, check, or exclude. The mark functions are the backbone of the package. Mark functions make new columns with the metadata criteria output appended to the existing data frame. So you pass a data frame to the mark functions to see which rows meet the metadata criteria. Mark function names simple prepend <code>mark_</code> to the metadata tag. So, for example, the function that marks preview metadata (<code>preview</code>) is <code>mark_preview()</code>.</p>
<p>Before we start marking, let’s look at an example data set that we can work with. The <code>qualtrics_text</code> data set includes both non-anonymous and computer metadata. We’ll just look at the first six rows by piping to <code>head()</code>.</p>

<p>There are two important outputs. First, we have an informational message telling us that <em>2 rows were collected as previews</em>. Each mark function will output this kind of message letting us know how many rows meet each metadata criterion. Second, we now have a new column called <code>exclusion_preview</code> appended to the data frame. Notice that the first two rows of that column have <code>preview</code> values while the rest of the rows are blank. We have now marked which rows meet this metadata criterion. ☑️</p>
<p>Of course, you may want to mark your data for multiple metadata criteria. To do this, you simply have to connect multiple mark functions with a pipe (either <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/pipeOp.html">base R’s <code>|&gt;</code></a> or <a href="https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html">magrittr’s %&gt;%</a>). So if we want to mark preview data and all rows where the completion duration is less than 200 seconds or more than 600 seconds, we just chain these together. In fact, we can also pull the data frame out of functions as well. Note that for clarity, I use the <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html"><code>select()</code></a> function from <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html">dplyr</a> to show just a subset of columns and rows.</p>

<p>Now we have three messages regarding rows that meet the criteria: one for previews, one for short completion times, and one for long completion times. We also now have a new <code>exclusion_duration</code> column added that marks rows that are too quick or too slow.</p>
<p>You can pipe together as many mark functions as you would like to get a feel for which data rows meet your different criteria. But adding a new column for each criterion can make it difficult to visualize everything together. If you want to combine all of your criteria into a single column, add the <code>unite_exclusions()</code> function at the end of the chain. Rows meeting multiple criteria will separate those criteria with commas.</p>

<p>The mark functions are nice to view rows that meet all of your different criteria, but it can be unwieldy to use this if you have large data sets or sparse cases that meet criteria. The <code>check</code> functions help with this by extracting only the rows that meet the criterion. So you can view just the problematic data.

<p>The check functions are useful for viewing rows meeting individual criteria. But you probably do not want to pipe multiple check functions together because each function outputs only the subset of the data that meets that criterion. So piping multiple check functions returns the rows that meet all of the criteria at once (the <em>intersection</em> of the criteria in set theory lingo).</p>

<p>This leaves all rows except the ones that meet the criterion, in this case, the 10 rows out of 100 that have duplicate IP addresses. The exclude functions are like the opposite of the check functions. Therefore, we can pipe multiple exclude functions together to remove data based on multiple metadata criteria.</p>

<p>As we exclude, the messages tell us how many rows are returned from each functions, so we can see how the data frame gets smaller at each step. While the order of the functions shouldn’t influence the final data frame output, it might make sense to use criteria with many exclusions early to speed processing of subsequent exclusions.</p>

<p>Congratulations—we have now removed all of our problematic data! 🎉 However, those data frames may still have identifying information included in them (e.g., IP addresses and geolocation).

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Before the fun part of analyzing data, we often need to perform some more tedious steps. The <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/">qualtRics</a> package is a huge help in automating the import of data into R. As we learned in <a href="../../blog/2022/08/02/working-with-qualtrics-data-importing/">Part 1</a>, after connecting to the Qualtrics API, we can quickly (and powerfully) import our Qualtrics data with the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/reference/fetch_survey.html"><code>fetch_survey()</code></a> function. Once those data are imported, we can use the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/excluder/">excluder</a> package to deal with potentially problematic online survey data based on respondent metadata, using the mark, check, and exclude functions. Then we can deidentify our data set before continuing to work with it or passing it on to others. Combined, these two packages can improve your data workflow by automating import and early cleaning processes, leaving the fun part of data processing up to you!</p>

  <title>Working with Qualtrics Data - Part 1: Importing Data</title>
  <dc:creator>Jeffrey Stevens</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>Note: Cross-posted with <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2022/08/02/working-with-qualtrics-data-importing/">rOpenSci blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>The online survey system <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a> can be a great way to collect data from research participants, customers, and stakeholders. I use it frequently to conduct research studies with participants or just to poll students and collaborators. However, while Qualtrics makes survey design straightforward, once the data are collected, there is a lot of work to do. Fortunately, two R packages (<a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/">qualtRics</a><sup>1</sup> and <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/excluder/">excluder</a><sup>2</sup>) can make importing data and excluding low-quality data easier.</p>
<p>Discovering the qualtRics package has saved me a lot of time importing data. It also lets me create data pipelines for sensitive data by reading files directly into R without saving them locally until they’ve been deidentified. This way I don’t accidentally save personally identifiable information in a place that is not authorized for sensitive data.</p>
<p>After importing data, there is often a lot of clean up that needs to happen, especially for online survey respondents. I developed the excluder package to help with removing data entries based on broad metadata such as response duration, respondent location, screen resolution, etc. Combining the qualtRics and excluder packages can help you deal with the tedious part of survey data and quickly get to the fun part of data analysis!</p>
<p>Part 1 of this series will show you how to use qualtRics to import your data, and we’ll cover excluding your data with excluder in <a href="../../blog/2022/08/09/working-with-qualtrics-data-excluding/">Part 2</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importing-qualtrics-data-into-r">Importing Qualtrics data into R</h2>
<p>If you’ve worked with Qualtrics data before, you know you have to log into Qualtrics, navigate to the data section, wait for all of the data to be “re-indexed” for viewing, choose whether to export as numeric or character values, choose what type of file to export, download the data file, find the downloaded data file, change the name of the file to something comprehensible, and delete those first two obnoxious rows of metadata. 😮‍💨 Having to go through this process manually every time that you want to download Qualtrics data can be cumbersome and time consuming.</p>

<p>Enter, the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/">qualtRics</a> package from <a href="https://juliasilge.com/">Julia Silge</a> and <a href="https://jasperhg90.github.io/">Jasper Ginn</a><sup>3</sup>. This package allows you to use the Qualtrics API to directly connect to your survey data. You can download a list of surveys in your account, as well as the actual questions and metadata about those questions. But, most importantly, the qualtRics package allows you to download Qualtrics data into your R session. Therefore, you can write scripts that automatically import your Qualtrics data whenever you run your script. No more time wasted downloading manually!</p>
<section id="connecting-to-qualtrics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="connecting-to-qualtrics">Connecting to Qualtrics</h3>
<p>Of course, to get your data, you have to have access to your Qualtrics account. The <a href="https://api.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics API</a> allows you to connect to your Qualtrics account with your personal API token (or key) and your datacenter ID. You can <a href="https://api.qualtrics.com/ZG9jOjg3NjYzMg-api-key-authentication">find your API token</a> by logging into Qualtrics, going to <em>Account Settings</em>, selecting the <em>Qualtrics IDs</em> tab, finding the <em>API</em> box, clicking <em>Generate Token</em>, and copying the long string of random letters and numbers shown next to <em>Token</em>. Note this key is like your password for accessing your account, so don’t share it with others. 🤫</p>

<p>Your datacenter ID can now be appended before <code>qualtrics.com</code> to generate your base URL: <code>yourdatacenterid.qualtrics.com</code> (don’t include <code>https://</code>). You can use the qualtRics function <code>qualtrics_api_credentials()</code> to connect your R session to the Qualtrics API.</p>

<p>Now your R session should have access to your Qualtrics account. But if you start a new R session, you’ll have to rerun this command. And it is not recommended to save this command in an R script because, if you send the script to someone else or post it publicly in a repository, you are granting access to your Qualtrics account to other people. 😬</p>
<p>To avoid having to rerun the command, you can store your API token and base URL on your local computer by using <code>install = TRUE</code>. Including this argument will save the API token and base URL information in your <code>.Renviron</code> file, which is read when starting every new R session.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

</div>
<p>Now you’ll either need to restart your R session or reload your environment with <code>readRenviron("~/.Renviron")</code> to make the credentials accessible in the current R session.</p>
<p>If you use <code>install = TRUE</code>, this means that your credentials are stored in a plain text file on your computer. So this may not be something that you want to do on a shared computer account. You must decide between the security of not storing credentials on your computer and the convenience of not having to enter your credentials for every new R session. ⚖️</p>

<section id="listing-your-surveys" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="listing-your-surveys">Listing your surveys</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve connected to your Qualtrics account, one of the first things you may want to do is list the surveys that you have in your account. While you can do this by hand through the Qualtrics website, you can also download a list of all surveys as a data frame with <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/reference/all_surveys.html"><code>all_surveys()</code></a>.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1">surveys <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">all_surveys</span>() </span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can then view data frame to find the survey that you want.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<p>The <code>id</code> column lists the survey ID for each survey (starting with <code>SV_</code>). This is a unique identifier that Qualtrics uses to label each survey. You will need the survey ID to download or work with it, so make sure to copy it from the data frame.</p>
</section>
<section id="importing-surveys" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importing-surveys">Importing surveys</h3>
<p>Now that we know which survey we want, we can import it using <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/reference/fetch_survey.html"><code>fetch_survey()</code></a> and the survey ID.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1">mysurvey <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"SV_XXXXXXXXXX"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This imports the survey as a data frame. The <code>fetch_survey()</code> function has many arguments that are helpful in importing your data. Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set your time zone with <code>time_zone</code>. This is important because, if you don’t set it in your Account Settings, Qualtrics has a default time zone that may differ from your own.</p></li>
<li><p>Extract entries during a particular time period with <code>start_date</code> and/or <code>end_date</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Import only certain questions with <code>include_questions</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Control whether you import choice text or numeric data with <code>label</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the function try to guess the proper data types for your columns with <code>convert</code> or specify the data types with <code>col_types</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Save your data frame locally with the <code>save_dir</code> argument. Note it saves the file as an RDS file, so you’ll need something like <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/readRDS.html"><code>readRDS()</code></a> to read it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Find out more about this function in the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/reference/fetch_survey.html"><code>fetch_survey()</code> documentation</a>.</p>
<p><code>fetch_survey()</code> allows you to automatically import your Qualtrics surveys directly—no more messy and time-consuming downloads! But if you’ve already downloaded a file from Qualtrics, you can use qualtRics’ <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/reference/read_survey.html"><code>read_survey()</code></a> function to import that file and clean up some Qualtrics messiness like removing those first two obnoxious rows and allowing control over the time zone and column data types.</p>
</section>
<section id="viewing-survey-info" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="viewing-survey-info">Viewing survey info</h3>
<p>While <code>fetch_survey()</code> provides the core functionality of the qualtRics package, the package also includes some other helper functions that allow you to view information about your survey.</p>
<p>You can get a data frame that includes all survey questions and their IDs and names with <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/reference/survey_questions.html"><code>survey_questions()</code></a>. To really drill down into your survey, use the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/reference/metadata.html"><code>metadata()</code></a> function. Not only can you access general metadata about your survey (survey name, owner ID, organization ID, creation/modification dates), but you can get more detailed information about your questions (question labels, question type, response option descriptions), block information, and survey flow. You can access information about the survey distribution, mailing lists, etc. with other functions. It’s definitely worth exploring all of the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/reference/index.html">helper functions</a>.</p>
