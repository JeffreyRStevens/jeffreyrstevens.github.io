Graduate Students
-----------------

### Anwyn Gatesy-Davis

![](images/anwyn_gatesy-davis.jpg){fig-alt="Anwyn Gatesy-Davis" width="200" fig-align="left"}

Anwyn is a Ph.D. student who earned their B.A. in Psychology and Animal Behavior from Hampshire College in 2020. Their senior thesis was a study on dogs' ability to follow human pointing gestures and compared the point-following abilities of herding breeds to that of non-herding breeds. After graduating, Anwyn worked as a lab manager for Dr. Daphna Buchsbaum's Computational Cognitive Development Lab and Brown Dog Lab at Brown University. Anwyn is interested in how our long history of breeding dogs to help us on farms has shaped the behavior and cognition of those dogs.

<!-- ### Francine Goh -->

<!-- ![](images/francine_goh.jpg){fig-alt="Francine Goh" width="200" fig-align="left"} -->

<!-- Francine graduated with a B.S. in Psychology from Fontbonne University in 2015. As an undergraduate, she explored the effects of stress on decision making in social dilemmas for her senior thesis. Francine is interested in decision making behavior in social contexts, particularly in when individuals decide to engage in prosocial behavior and cooperate with others. -->

### London Wolff

London graduated with honors in Biology and Animal Behavior, Ecology and Conservation from Canisius College in 2016. She completed her senior thesis on the affects of the domestication process on dogs’ social cognitive skills. Subsequently she researched decision making with orangutans and dolphins as well as long-tailed macaque social structure at the Indianapolis Zoo. London is interested in exploring how social structure and developmental differences of individuals across and within species impact their decision making processes, specifically looking at impulsivity and risk taking.
